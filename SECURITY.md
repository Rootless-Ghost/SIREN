# Security Considerations

## ⚠️ Important Notice

SIREN is designed to help security teams document and export incident reports. Because incident reports contain **sensitive security data**, please review and follow these guidelines before deploying SIREN in any environment.

---

## Data Handling Best Practices

### Sensitive Data in Reports

Incident reports generated by SIREN may contain:

- Internal IP addresses and hostnames
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) — malicious IPs, domains, file hashes
- Analyst names and organizational details
- Vulnerability details and exploitation methods
- Affected system information and network topology hints
- Credentials or credential-adjacent data (usernames, email addresses)

### Storage & Transmission

1. **Do NOT expose SIREN to the public internet.** Run it on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) or behind a VPN/firewall.
2. **Do NOT commit generated reports to public repositories.** Add `*.generated.md` and `*.generated.json` to your `.gitignore`.
3. **Encrypt reports at rest** if storing them on disk. Use tools like `gpg`, BitLocker, or FileVault.
4. **Use HTTPS** if deploying SIREN on a network. Configure Flask behind a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) with TLS.
5. **Sanitize IOCs before sharing.** Defang malicious URLs and IPs (e.g., `hxxps://` instead of `https://`, `[.]` instead of `.`) when sharing reports externally.

### Access Control

- Restrict access to SIREN to authorized incident response team members only.
- If deploying in a team environment, implement authentication (Flask-Login, SSO, etc.).
- Review Flask's `SECRET_KEY` configuration — the default generates a random key per session. For persistent deployments, set a strong static key via environment variable.

## Application Security

### Current Limitations

SIREN is a **portfolio/learning project** and does not include:

- Authentication or authorization
- Input sanitization beyond basic HTML escaping
- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection (beyond Flask's built-in session security)
- Audit logging

### Recommended Hardening for Production Use

If adapting SIREN for production use:

1. Add authentication (Flask-Login, OAuth, or SSO integration)
2. Implement CSRF tokens on all form submissions
3. Add input validation and sanitization on the server side
4. Enable rate limiting (Flask-Limiter)
5. Set security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
6. Deploy behind a reverse proxy with TLS termination
7. Add audit logging for report generation events
8. Run as a non-root user in a containerized environment

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SIREN itself (not in the reports it generates), please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

**How to report:**
- Use GitHub's **Security Advisories** feature: Navigate to the Security tab and click "Report a vulnerability"


**Response timeline:**
- Initial response: Within 48 hours
- Status update: Within 7 days
- Fix timeline: Depends on severity (Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days, Medium: 30 days)
