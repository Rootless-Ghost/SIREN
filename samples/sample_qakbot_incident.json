    "executive_summary": "On February 10, 2025, at 09:15 UTC, the SOC detected anomalous network traffic originating from workstation WS-PC042 in the Finance department. Investigation revealed a Qakbot banking trojan infection initiated through a phishing email containing a weaponized Excel spreadsheet (.xlsm). The malware established persistence via scheduled tasks and attempted lateral movement to two additional workstations. The incident was contained within 2.5 hours of detection, with full eradication completed by 16:30 UTC. No data exfiltration was confirmed, though the C2 channel was active for approximately 45 minutes before blocking. Three systems were re-imaged as a precaution. This report documents the full incident timeline, indicators of compromise, and recommended remediation actions.",
